# About

I am currently studying BSc Computer Science at the University of Pretoria. I am a very passionate and dedicated programmer.  I have great time management skills and I am determined to finish my projects well before the deadlines.  I also apply risk management when projects are assigned and put contingency plans in place to minimize the risk that may occur.  Working on a few group projects have also developed my teamwork skills.

# Experiences

I have experience in the following programming languages:

- Java
- C++
- Android development
- Python
- Web development (HTML, CSS, Javascrpt, etc.)
- Prolog
- Scheme

I was also part of the integration group for a project. Our group's responsibility is to integrate various parts of coding from other groups into one project.

I am also good at detecting various design patterns and I am also good at using various data structures. I love doing web development and I have experience in both front-end as well as back-end development of a website.
