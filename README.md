# About

I am currently studying BSc Computer Science at the University of Pretoria. I love programming and I am dedicated to do my work. I have great time management skills and I am determined to finish my projects well before the deadline. I work well with others as I am currently involved in a few group projects.

# Experiences

I have experience in the following programming languages:

- Java
- C++
- Android development
- Python
- Web development (HTML, CSS, Javascrpt, etc.)
- Prolog
- Scheme

I am also part of the integration group for a project. Our group's responsibility is to integrate various parts of coding from other groups into one project.

I am also good at detecting various design patterns and I am also good at using various data structures. I love doing web development and I have experience in both front-end as well as back-end development of a website.
